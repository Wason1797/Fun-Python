# Fun Python

This library is a fun litle project, most of the programs are my take on The Coding Train's
coding challenges

## Some of the projects i made

- **Python Basics**
  - Simple sintax and operations in python [first_app.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Fundamentals/first_app.py")
  - A test file, its not super important, contains a simple matrix class [test_file.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Fundamentals/test_file.py")
  - Inreoduction to turtle graphics, recursive spiral exercise [recursive_spiral.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Fractal_Trees/recursive_spiral.py")
- **Fractal Trees**
  - Recursive aproach to draw fractal trees (i took the code from an internet example) [app.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Fractal_Trees/app.py")
  - Object oriented aproach [object_fractal_trees.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Fractal_Trees/object_fractal_trees.py")
  - L-System aproach [fractal_l_system.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Fractal_Trees/fractal_l_system.py")
- **3D graphics and shapes with pygame**
  - 3D cube render with rotation (using matrix operations) [3D_render.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/3D_Graphics_Shapes/3D_render.py")
  - 3D Lorentz Attractor, also with the same aproach as before [lorentz..py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/3D_Graphics_Shapes/lorentz.py")
  - Lemniscata, this drawing looks as the infinity symbol (this one is 2D) [lemniscata.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/3D_Graphics_Shapes/lemniscata.py")
- **Snake Game**
  - Simple snake game, _this one was taken from a popular yourube video_ [sanake.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Games/snake.py")
- **Traveling Salesperson problem**
  - Lexicographic order aproach -> this one is like brute forcing into the solution, not  super fast [LexSalesperson.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Traveling_Salesperson/LexSalesperson.py")
  - Genetic algotithm aproach -> this one is more fun, i implemented this one with cross-over and mutation, also i select my population in a random without repetition way, it may need some improvements tho [genSalesperson.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Traveling_Salesperson/genSalesperson.py")
- **Tensorflow**
  - Linear Regression with gradient descent but no interactivity [tsExample.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Tensor%20Flow/tsExample.py")
  - Linear Regresion with gradient descent optimizer and interactivity, this script allows you to provide the points on a canvas, so the computer will adjust a line and show it to you [tsLinearRegression.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Tensor%20Flow/tsLinearRegression.py")
  - Polynomial Regresion, cuadratic aproach with interactivity (same as the linear one) [tsPolyRegression.py]("https://github.com/Wason1797/Fun-Python/blob/master/Tensor%20Flow/tsPolyRegression.py")

## Resources

Coding Train's youtube chanel and all de documentation on the tools i used.
_I'll provide the concrete resources (links to videos and such) i used on another time, i need to gather them all again_

## Tools

- pygame
- numpy
- tensorflow
- turtle
