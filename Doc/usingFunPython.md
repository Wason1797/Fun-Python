3. Install `virtualenv`, this will allow you to make your own python enviroments.

    - Open your command line and type: `pip install virtualenv`
    - Open the directory in which you would like to create an enviroment and type `virtualenv [the name of yor virtual enviroment]`, mainly i use venv so the command should look like this: `virtualenv venv`.

4. Activate your virtual enviroment:
    - So after you created a virtual enviroment you need to activate it, so go to the directory in which you created it, inside a folder called venv you will find many other folders, go to the one called scripts, and inside it open a terminal or cmd and type: `activate`
    - Now you will see a change on the cmd, that lets you know you are running commands on your virtualenv
